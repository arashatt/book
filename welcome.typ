Hi, Iâ€™m Arash Attari ðŸ‘‹

This is where I share pieces of my journeyâ€”sometimes technical, sometimes personal, often a mix of both.

I studied Computer Science at Shahrood University of Technology, and ever since, Iâ€™ve been fascinated by how systemsâ€”whether in technology or in lifeâ€”work together. These days, I spend much of my time at LimoHost, configuring servers and diving deeper into the world of DevOps and distributed systems.

But my interests donâ€™t stop at code. I enjoy interpreting classic Persian poetry alongside the works of Shakespeare, trying to uncover how timeless words connect with todayâ€™s questions. At the same time, Iâ€™m preparing for the IELTS and TOEFL exams, which adds another dimension to my love for language.

On the technical side, Iâ€™m experimenting with tools and ideas that challenge me:

Writing in Rust with Ratatui

Exploring Perl and backend services

Building apps with Next.js and Prisma

Testing the Linux kernel in QEMU

Even venturing into theorem proving with Isabelle

And sometimes, I think about starting a novel in English, just to see where imagination and discipline might take me.

This blog will be a place for reflections, tutorials, and maybe even poetry. Thanks for stopping byâ€”letâ€™s see where this journey leads.
